	<h1>“Values help define priorities”</h1>
	<h2>Mr. Ian Huang 14 Nov 2018</h2>
	<p>SPECIAL Hall Night Talk, a monthly affair invites prominent personalities to share their experiences to the resident community. For the month of November, Mr Ian Huang, Chairman and CEO of Digital Transformation Ltd. Was invited to share his experience on how he became a businessman from an engineer. He has worked many years in Silicon Valley and is now back in Hong Kong shaking the digital and technology industry with his ventures.  
	<br><br>
In his sharing, he talked about the importance of values, his career path, the role of mentors and some essential transitions he went through to become the man he is today. The talk was relevant to the students as it is the right stage to think about the future, and we should begin with setting our values, which define our priorities and prepare ourselves for the world of work with a mentor by our side.  
	<br><br>
He highlighted that values are the most important as they guide our actions and our priorities. For him, the most important value was to make a difference to the society, have financial freedom and not be limited to a cheerleader. This guided him to take opportunities, innovate and eventually he was able to design remarkable electronic components which did make a difference to the society and also made him wealthy. 
	<br><br>
Each career position taught him different skills and finally as a businessman he now understands the overall big picture. Each boss or mentor also taught him important lessons which facilitated him to shape his career. He advised the students to find a mentor and talked about a mentor-mentee relationship, which works on mutual respect and benefit. To find a mentor, a mentee needs to make them see why spending time is worthwhile for the mentor. It is also important to truly listen and digest. He shared that as youth we are more malleable and can shape ourselves better, so we should move from past best skills and also develop new skills in the process of growing up. 
<br><br>
With his precious advice not only on career but life made the talk truly inspiring. The audience was very positive and motivated to set their own values and establish a mentor and mentee relationship for a successful career and life.
